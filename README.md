The Variational AutoEncoder was implemented for the MNIST Dataset with the loss curves for training and validation sets 
and a Fully Connected Feedforward Network and the visual of handwritten digits were shown in MNIST using VAE. 

Latent vectors were sampled and images were reconstructed with the variational autoencoder handwritten digit plotted.
